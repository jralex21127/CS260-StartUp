# Practice Makes Purrfect

[My Notes](notes.md)

A brief description of the application here. 

There are several goal tracking apps out there, but many have features are behind a paywall. As a broke college student, I usually begin using one and hit that wall, uninstall the app immediately and resort to gold ole paper to record my goals. Now I have the opportunity to create my own goal tracking app with the features I wish other apps had and without the ones I don't like.

"Practice Makes Purrfect" is a working title that is just fun because I also want to incorporate cats into the display and actions of the app/website. Users create and customize a cat to represent themselves that can accomplish goals with them.

### Elevator pitch

"Practice Makes Purrfect" is a goal tracking tool to help take your goals to the next level, all while having a fun cat to cheer you on. People set goals to better themselves, but forming new habits or ditching old ones can prove difficult. With this application, I hope to share with others and have a way to use my favorite goal keeping tips: streaks, accountability partners, reminders, and multiple ways to record goal completion.

### Key features

- **Streaks:** records how many days in a row the user has met their goal. _(also records their longest streak)_
- **Accountability Partner(s):** connects users so they can work on goals together, whether the same goal or just to have someone to update about their goal.
- **Multiple Ways to Record Completion**: I like to record if I partially met a goal, so offering that flexibility.
- **Cat Cheerleader**: a cat to decorate because I thought it would be fun. Might ditch it if it gets too crazy. Mostly for connecting to other users, it's fun to have a little avatar. Also is the whole point for calling my startup "Practice Makes Purrfect".
- Secure login over HTTPS
- ability to create and record goals
